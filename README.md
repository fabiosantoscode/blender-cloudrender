# CloudRender

CloudRender is a renderer working on the CrowdProcess platform.

CloudRender is based on the emcycles project, a port of the Blender Cycles standalone renderer to javascript using emscripten, and also on the cycles XML exporter.

It's still a bit of a prototype, but can already be used to slowly perform renders.
